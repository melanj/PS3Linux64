# PS3Linux64: Debian PPC64 for PlayStation 3  

This is a personal project to set up a Debian-based Linux environment on the PlayStation 3. It includes a repackaged Debian PPC64 root filesystem created using `debootstrap` and a custom Linux kernel built for the PS3’s Cell processor.  

To automate the process, I’ve put together a set of shell scripts that handle kernel compilation, root filesystem setup, and necessary configurations. The project also includes a toolchain for building software on the PS3, with support for libraries like `libspe2` to take advantage of the SPEs.  

Since not everyone has the time or setup to build everything from scratch, I’m considering making prebuilt images available. If anyone is interested, feel free to reach out.  

### Features:  
- Debian PPC64 root filesystem built with `debootstrap`.  
- Custom Linux kernel for the PS3.  
- Shell scripts to streamline the setup process.  
- Toolchain for compiling software, including `libspe2` for Cell SPE support.  
- Potential prebuilt images for those who prefer to skip the build process.  

### Installation:
